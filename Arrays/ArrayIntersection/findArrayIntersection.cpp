/* Question : You are given two arrays 'A' and 'B' of size 'N' and 'M' respectively. Both these arrays 
    are sorted in non-decreasing order. You have to find the intersection of these two arrays.
    Intersection of two arrays is an array that consists of all the common elements occurring 
    in both arrays.
*/

/* Example 1 
    Input: arr1 = 1 2 2 2 3 4, arr2 = 2 2 3 3
    Output: 2 2 3
    Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the 
                 same number of occurrences.

/* Example 2 
    Input: arr1 = 1 2 3, arr2 = 3 4
    Output: 3
